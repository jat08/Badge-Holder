# **Disclaimer**

The badge holder is still being developed and improved; your product might look slightly different from the pictures shown here. However, functionality will remain. Consumer 3D Printing Technology has lots of variability which results in products not being the same amongst themselves. The variability of printing, materials and assembly can also produce minor cosmetic defects; however, they do not affect functionality.
